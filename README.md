# Stack and Queue Implementation in C#

## Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of stack and queue data structures in C# using the `MyStack` and `MyQueue` generic classes. As a software engineer with a passion for continuous learning, I built this project some time ago to delve into the fundamentals of data structures.

## Project Structure

- `MyStack.cs`: Contains the implementation of the stack data structure.
- `MyQueue.cs`: Implements the queue data structure.

## Usage

Feel free to explore the code and use it in your projects. The generic nature of these classes allows flexibility in adapting them to various scenarios.

## Notes

Please note that I initially developed this project some time ago. While the core concepts remain relevant, it's always a good practice to review and update code as needed.

## Contributions

If you have any suggestions, improvements, or find any issues, please feel free to contribute by opening an issue or a pull request.

Happy coding!
